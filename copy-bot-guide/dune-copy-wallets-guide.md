There are many sections on this dashboard using different approaches to find copywallets. You can find top traders from Trojan, BullX, and Photon users. However, we will scroll down to the bottom for finding top traders by token. This approach is similar to finding copywallets by checking the top traders of a token on DexScreener.

First, I will enter the CA for $CROCS: 7u6WirUYbf3kJdZQoPTCYjgU5rpVg21LuXLKmmCUpump

Then, I will enter a MinBuy of 0.1 Sol

Hit Enter to run the query:

Copy/paste a wallet address and head over to [https://gmgn.ai/](https://gmgn.ai/)

You can check out the wallet's trade history, PnL distribution, and win rate. Check out a few of them and if it looks good, add it to your copy\_wallets.txt!
