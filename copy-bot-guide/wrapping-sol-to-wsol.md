4.  **Verify Balance**

    After wrapping, verify that you have both SOL and wSOL in your wallet. SOL will be used for gas fees, and wSOL will be used for trading.

By following these steps, you ensure that your wallet is properly set up with the necessary SOL and wSOL to operate the Tachyon Copybot effectively.
