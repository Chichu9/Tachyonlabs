# Introduction to Copy Trading

### What is Copytrading? <a href="#what-is-copytrading" id="what-is-copytrading"></a>

Copytrading is a popular investment strategy where traders automatically replicate the trades of experienced and successful investors. By copying their trades, users can potentially achieve similar returns without needing in-depth market knowledge or investing time in active trading. This approach democratizes trading, allowing even novice investors to benefit from the expertise of seasoned traders.

### What is a CLI Bot? <a href="#what-is-a-cli-bot" id="what-is-a-cli-bot"></a>

A Command Line Interface (CLI) bot is a type of automated trading bot that operates through command line inputs rather than a graphical user interface (GUI) like those found in Telegram bots. CLI bots are typically more powerful and flexible, offering a range of customizable options and advanced features for experienced users. While they may have a steeper learning curve compared to GUI-based bots, they provide greater control and efficiency for managing trades.

### How Does a Copytrading Bot Work? <a href="#how-does-a-copytrading-bot-work" id="how-does-a-copytrading-bot-work"></a>

The copytrading bot on Solana works by connecting to a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) endpoint. The RPC endpoint allows the bot to interact directly with the Solana blockchain, facilitating the execution of trades and retrieval of market data in real-time. Here’s a simplified overview of the process:

* **Connecting to the RPC**: The bot establishes a connection with a specified Solana RPC endpoint.
* **Monitoring Trades**: It continuously monitors the trading activity of selected expert traders.
* **Replicating Trades**: When the bot detects a new trade from an expert, it replicates the trade on behalf of the user.
* **Handling Transactions**: The bot manages all transactions, including calculating and deducting fees, ensuring that trades are executed promptly and accurately.

### Benefits of Using a CLI Bot <a href="#benefits-of-using-a-cli-bot" id="benefits-of-using-a-cli-bot"></a>

**Greater Control and Customization**

CLI bots offer users extensive control over their trading parameters and strategies. Users can customize the bot’s behavior to suit their specific needs, such as setting risk levels, trade amounts, and timing.

**Enhanced Performance**

CLI bots typically run more efficiently than GUI-based bots because they consume fewer system resources. This can result in faster trade execution and reduced latency, which are crucial for high-frequency trading.

**Flexibility and Scalability**

With a CLI bot, users can easily integrate additional functionalities and adapt to changing market conditions. The bot can be configured to handle complex trading strategies and can scale to manage multiple trading accounts simultaneously.

**Security**

Operating a bot via CLI reduces the attack surface compared to bots that rely on external platforms like Telegram. One of the key security advantages of a CLI bot is that the private key used to sign transactions remains on the user's computer. This means that the private key is never sent or stored on any external database, ensuring that sensitive information stays secure and under the user's control.

* **Pump.fun Trading**: You can also copytrade on Pump.fun, enabling you to participate in high-risk, high-reward trading strategies specific to this platform.

#### 3. Fast Transaction Execution <a href="#id-3.-fast-transaction-execution" id="id-3.-fast-transaction-execution"></a>

* **Speed**: Tachyon Copybot is optimized for speed, with the capability to land your transaction within 1 second of the transaction you are copying. This is influenced by several factors:
  * **VPS to RPC Latency**: The lower the latency between your VPS and the RPC, the faster your transactions will be.
  * **gRPC**: Utilizing gRPC (Geyser) can enhance performance by streaming real-time updates, reducing latency.
  * **Jito Tip**: Adjusting your Jito tip can prioritize your transactions, ensuring they are processed swiftly.

#### 4. Proportional Trading <a href="#id-4.-proportional-trading" id="id-4.-proportional-trading"></a>

* **Buying**: Copybot will buy the amount specified in your quote size, mirroring the trades of the wallets you are copying.
* **Selling**: When the copy wallet sells, the bot will sell a proportional amount of your holdings. If the copy wallet sells all their holdings, you will sell everything as well. If they scale out and take smaller profits as the token price increases, the bot will do the same, selling amounts proportional to what the copy wallet sells.

#### 5. Token Transfer Detection <a href="#id-5.-token-transfer-detection" id="id-5.-token-transfer-detection"></a>

* **Seamless Tracking**: If the wallet you are copying transfers their tokens to another wallet, the bot will automatically track the recipient wallet.
* **Continued Copy Trading**: This ensures that when the recipient wallet sells the tokens, you will also sell, maintaining your copy trading strategy without interruption.
